# WindLife Test
 
Introducing my cinematic creation, created using Unity's Timeline and Cinemachine. This short film is a test proposed by WildLife, meant to demonstrate the potential of an FPS game. I constructed this cinematic using only free assets from the Unity Asset Store and animations from Mixamo. The story follows a storyboard in which the player must carry out a mission to rescue hostages held by terrorists, with a dramatic bullet time effect on the final shot. 

Check the video below to see the final result of this cinematic.
